HTML5 and CSS (5 hours) - notes

 - Introduced the basics of different HTML5 elements and CSS styling techniques.
 - Showed various ways to override CSS selectors using the '.class' functionality, 
 using the #id, attribute, as well as the "!important" selector to ensure that an 
 element you're styling is styled appropriately. Also showed how 'inline' styling 
 works.
 - CSS classes basically allow you to apply 'styles' programatically to HTML elements, 
 which saves the work of having to style each on individually, or change them 
 individually if an updated style wants to be used.
 - Illustrated the basics of adding images, hyperlinks (anchor tags), and form elements, 
 along with 'some' of the basics showing how to add buttons, and 'actions' to a 
 web page. Though this wasn't covered in much detail, because it likely involves a 
 good amount of javascript. Radiobuttons, checkboxes, submit buttons, etc.
 - Gets into a bit about adding padding and margins to elements to space them out 
 appropriately...introduced the 'clockwise' notation for styling from top, right, 
 bottom, and to the left. What's the difference between padding and margin?
 - Introduced the <div> element that allows you to 'break' your page down into 
 separate sections, that can then be individually controlled/styled.
 - Showed how to use all 16M+ colors using the 'color:#FFA4B9' hex color encodings.
 - Shows how to use the open-source fonts that google provides on your site.
 - Create numbered and unordered lists.
