HTML5 and CSS (5 hours) - notes

 - Introduced the basics of different HTML5 elements and CSS styling techniques.
 - Showed various ways to override CSS selectors using the '.class' functionality, 
 using the #id, attribute, as well as the "!important" selector to ensure that an 
 element you're styling is styled appropriately. Also showed how 'inline' styling 
 works.
 - CSS classes basically allow you to apply 'styles' programatically to HTML elements, 
 which saves the work of having to style each on individually, or change them 
 individually if an updated style wants to be used.
 - Illustrated the basics of adding images, hyperlinks (anchor tags), and form elements, 
 along with 'some' of the basics showing how to add buttons, and 'actions' to a 
 web page. Though this wasn't covered in much detail, because it likely involves a 
 good amount of javascript. Radiobuttons, checkboxes, submit buttons, etc.
 - Gets into a bit about adding padding and margins to elements to space them out 
 appropriately...introduced the 'clockwise' notation for styling from top, right, 
 bottom, and to the left. What's the difference between padding and margin?
 - Introduced the <div> element that allows you to 'break' your page down into 
 separate sections, that can then be individually controlled/styled.
 - Showed how to use all 16M+ colors using the 'color:#FFA4B9' hex color encodings.
 - Shows how to use the open-source fonts that google provides on your site.
 - Create numbered and unordered lists.
 
Responsive design with Bootstrap (5 hours) - notes
 
 - Bootstrap is a CSS framework (Code library) that is used for 'Responsive Design'.
 - Responsive Design is the idea that you shouldn't need to write multiple versions 
 of your webpage depending on what screen it is viewed on (i.e. mobile vs. 
 traditional browser).
 - Get Bootstrap by adding this line to your html file:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
 - The class 'container-fluid' is likely :) a CSS class provided by the Bootstrap 
 framework.
 - The class 'img-responsive' will make it so images will fill the entire width of 
 a phone, webpage, etc.
 - Class 'text-center' does just what it sounds like.
 - Class 'btn' is a CSS button that looks much nicer than the defaults.
 - Class 'btn-block' will force a btn element to take up the entire width of a screen. 
 Normally, btn elements are only as wide as the text they contain.
 - Class 'btn-primary' will add a color to you button, and should be used on the actions 
 you want your users to take.
 - Class 'btn-info' will highlight additional actions a user could take.
 - Class 'btn-danger' will highlight your button red.
 - Class 'row' allows you to apply it to a <div> element, and puts everything in one 
 row. Bootstrap rows are broken into 12 columns, and are specified as 'col-xs-*' where 
 the '*' referes to how many columns the element should span. 'xs' in this case refers 
 to the screen size of the displaying device (phone screen = xs).
 - Clever that the Bootstrap designers use '12' columns...why? Because you can divide 
 12 into integer 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4...smart.
 - Now we're getting into 'span' elements...what do they do?
 - You can add a cool library of icons called 'Font Awesome' by adding this:
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"/>
